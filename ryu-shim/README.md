# Ryu shim layer

The Ryu shim layer is one of the components of the NetIDE Network Engine and is implemented as application for the [Ryu controller](http://osrg.github.io/ryu/) by using the OpenFlow libraries included in the Ryu's [source code](https://github.com/osrg/ryu).  
Differently from previous versions of the Network Engine implementation which leveraged on the protocol used between the [Pyretic backend and the OpenFlow client](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/pyretic13.pdf), the current modules (such as shim layer and backend) use the NetIDE Intermediate protocol v1.0 to communicate with each other (see a short description in the [Network Engine introduction](https://github.com/fp7-netide/Engine)).

## Installation

To use the shim, first clone the Ryu code (from [here](https://github.com/osrg/ryu)) on a local machine and copy the ```netide``` folder into the ```ryu/ryu``` folder. After that, install Ryu by running the command ```python ./setup.py install``` from the ```ryu``` folder.
Then, add the Ryu's installation path to the PYTHONPATH variable in your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc (e.g. in a Ubuntu 14.04 Linux OS: ```export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ryu```).

Additional python packages may be required in order to succefully complete the installation procedure. On a Ubuntu 14.04 Linux OS the following must be installed:
* ```apt-get install python-pip python-dev python-repoze.lru libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev```
* ```pip install ecdsa```
* ```pip install stevedore```
* ```pip install greenlet```

## Running

In this second implementation of the Network Engine, the shim layer is a server (listening by default on port 41414) and handles the multiple connections from the client controllers through their backend layers. Therefore, to test the Ryu shim layer, simply run it with the following command:
```
ryu-manager ryu-shim.py
```

This command will start the shim layer along with the rest of the Ryu platform. As a result, you will obtain a process that waits for connections from the client controllers on the northbound and from the forwarding devices from the southbound.

**Note:** The Ryu controller platform listens for connections from the switches on the port 6633. Therefore, when using Mininet for testing purposes, start mininet by specifying the controller information as follows:
```
sudo mn --topo linear,4 --controller=remote,ip=IP_ADDRESS,port=6633
```

Where ```ryu-backend.py``` is the module that provides the communication with the ```ryu-shim``` through the Intermediate protocol and IP_ADDRESS is the IP address of the machine where the Ryu and the shim layer are running. The IP address specification is not needed when Ryu and Mininet are running on the same machine.

## Testing

To test the Ryu shim layer it is necessary to run one of the backends provided in this github repository that supports the NetIDE Intermediate protocol v1.0.
For instance, it can be tested with the Ryu backend by using the following command:

``` ryu-manager --ofp-tcp-listen-port 7733 ryu-backend.py tests/simple_switch.py```

Where ```simple_switch``` is a simple application provided for testing purposes. Other applications can be used as well. Many sample applications are available in the Ryu source tree in the ```ryu/app``` folder.

Within the Mininet CLI, a successful ```pingall``` demonstrates that the hosts are able to comminicate with each others.
