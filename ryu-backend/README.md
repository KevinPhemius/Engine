# Backend for the Ryu platform

The Ryu backend is one of the components of the NetIDE Network Engine and is implemented as application for the [Ryu controller](http://osrg.github.io/ryu/) by using the OpenFlow libraries included in the Ryu's [source code](https://github.com/osrg/ryu).  
Differently from previous versions of the Network Engine implementation which leveraged on the protocol used between the [Pyretic backend and the OpenFlow client](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/pyretic13.pdf), the current modules (such as shim layer and backend) use the NetIDE Intermediate protocol v1.X to communicate with each other (see a short description in the [Network Engine introduction](https://github.com/fp7-netide/Engine)).

## Installation

The Ryu backend is provided as an additional module for the Ryu controller. In order to use it, first clone the Ryu code (from [here](https://github.com/osrg/ryu)) on a local machine. Copy the ```python``` folder from ```../Libraries/netip``` into the ```ryu/ryu``` folder and rename it as ```netide```. After that, install Ryu by running the command ```python ./setup.py install``` from the ```ryu``` folder.
Then, add the Ryu's installation path to the PYTHONPATH variable in your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc (e.g. in a Ubuntu 14.04 Linux OS: ```export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ryu```).

Finally, install the Ryu controller by entering the ```ryu``` folder and by running the command:

```python ./setup.py install```

Additional python packages may be required in order to succefully complete the installation procedure. On a Ubuntu 14.04 Linux OS the following must be installed:
* ```apt-get install python-pip python-dev python-repoze.lru libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev python-zmq```
* ```pip install ecdsa```
* ```pip install stevedore```
* ```pip install greenlet```

## Running
Within the  ```ryu-backend``` folder, run the following command to use the Ryu backend with the, e.g., ```simple_switch ``` application on top of it:

``` ryu-manager --ofp-tcp-listen-port 7733 ryu-backend.py tests/simple_switch.py```

The Ryu backend will try to connect to a running NetIDE Core which must be already running and listening on the TCP port 41414.
The ```--ofp-tcp-listen-port 7733``` is used to avoid possible conflicts that may happen when two different controller platforms are running on the same machine. In our case we could have Ryu hosting the backend and, e.g., ONOS with the shim layer. By default they both bind the TCP port 6633 to accept connections from the network elements.

Finally, ```simple_switch``` is a simple L2 learning switch application provided for testing purposes. Other applications can be used as well. Many sample applications are available in the Ryu source tree in the ```ryu/app``` folder.

## Testing

To test the Ryu backend it is necessary to run one of the shim layers provided in this github repository and the NetIDE Core. Both must support the NetIDE Intermediate protocol v1.2.
In the ```tests``` folder, a minimal implementation of the Core is provided.
For instance, to use this backend with the Ryu shim run following sequence of commands:
```
python AdvancedProxyCore.py
ryu-manager ryu-shim.py
```

A network emulator such as Mininet can be used to test the software:
```
sudo mn --topo linear,4 --controller=remote,ip=IP_ADDRESS,port=6633
```
Where IP_ADDRESS is the IP address of the machine where the Ryu and the shim layer are running. The IP address specification is not needed when Ryu and Mininet are running on the same machine.

Once both Core and Ryu shim are running, the backend can be started with:

``` ryu-manager --ofp-tcp-listen-port 7733 ryu-backend.py tests/simple_switch.py```

Within the Mininet CLI, a successful ```pingall``` demonstrates that the hosts are able to comminicate with each others.
